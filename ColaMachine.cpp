/*Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)

Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of your 5 favorite beverages (Coke, Water, Sprite, ... , Whatever).
Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5.
Output which beverage they chose.

? If you program uses if statements instead of a switch statement, modify it to use a switch statement.
If instead your program uses a switch statement, modify it to use if/else-if statements.

?? Modify the program so that if the user enters a choice other than 1-5 then it will output "Error. choice was not valid, here is your money back."*/
